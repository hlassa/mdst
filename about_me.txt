Hey!

My name is Henry Lassa, and I am currently a Junior studying Data Science through LSA.
I am interested in MDST because I feel its a great opportunity to expand my DS knowledge,
as well as work on a practical project.
One fun fact about myself is that I can play the didgeridoo.
I really look forward to joining the club!
